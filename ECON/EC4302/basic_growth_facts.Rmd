Central questions:

1. Why are some countries much poorer than others?
2. Why do countries grow?
3. What are the sources of recessions and booms?
4. Why is there unemployment and what determines its extent?

Questions 1 and 2 belongs to growth theory, question 3
belong to business cycle and question 4 belong to
unemployment.

## Evolution of input factors

Growth rate for $x(t)$ where $\dot{x} := \frac{dx(t)}{dt}$
$$
g_x := \frac{\dot{x}}{x} = \frac{d\ln(x)}{dt} \Rightarrow
X(t) = X_0 e^{g_x t}
$$

Discrete-time growth rate:

$$
g_x = \Delta \ln(x_t) = \ln(x_{t+1})-\ln(x_t)
$$

## Equilibrium, steady-state, Balanced growth path, comparative statics, Golden-rule

- Equilibrium: $k^*$ such that $\dot{k} = 0 \Rightarrow k(t+1)=k(t)$
  - An economy in equilibrium is called in steady-state
- Balanced growth path: how other variables behave when $k = k^*$
- Comparative statics: how changing hyper-parameter change variables
- Golden-rule of capital accumulation: $k^*$ that maximises Consumption
