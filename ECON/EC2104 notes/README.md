# EC2104 Quantitative Methods for Economic Analysis

I'm preparing this set of files for EC2104 tutorial classes.
I've decided to try out Teaching Assistance in my last
semester in case I'm broke af when I start my PhD in the
future.

This is my first semester preparing these documents. Meaning
typo and mistakes are expected. Please refer to official
material and explanations for the final explanations.

I do not promise mistake-free notes, and you would be
referring to these documents at your own risk. I hope you
would understand the concept and challenge me if you
identify any mistakes.

## Before the notes

I wrote an overview expressing my personal opinion regarding
this module. You can refer to it in
[week0_overview](/week0_overview.pdf)

## Folder Structure

I'll prepare two documents weekly

1. Overview of the key ideas in each week's lecture (files
   starting with 'week')
2. Tutorial explanations (files starting with 'tutorial')

Tutorial explanations will be uploaded only at the end of
all tutorials. There might be edits along the way as I
correct mistakes in the files.
