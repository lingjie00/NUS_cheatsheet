# NUS cheatsheet
Sharing the cheatsheet I did for past modules

Cheatsheet helps me to revise better, I hope it will be useful for you too.
Sadly I was too lazy to do cheatsheet for some of the modules and some modules require hand written cheatsheet.

If anyone wants to share their cheatsheet too, please feel free to drop me a message.

If you identify any mistakes, please raise an issue.
