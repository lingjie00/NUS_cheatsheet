# FAQ for data career related questions

This document captures the frequency asked questions from juniors on how to
break into the data career. I'm new to the field and this document represents my
personal view as of now. Please do explore more opinions as well. My views might
be most relevant for economics majors, maybe workable for statistics majors.

I do not intend to say "what you should do", instead this document is written to
share my personal experience in hope to give some inspirations to you. The
sections are independent, you can read them in any orders and they are arranged
in time sequences in my data field exploration. If you have any questions that
is not covered by this document, please feel free to contact me.

Now time for my unqualified views.

### Education background

I graduated with a major in Economics (specialized in quantitative economics)
and second major in Statistics. Most of my modules taken are listed in the
cheat sheet.

### How and when did I start exploring data field

I started exploring data field after reading Susan Athey's [Machine Learning
Methods That Economists Should Know
About](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-080217-053433)
when I was in **year 2 sem 2**.
My introductory knowledge to machine learning
was Coursera [Applied Data Science with Python
Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python),
and later took MIT micro-masters course [Machine Learning with Python: from
Linear Models to Deep
Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to).
For deep learning content I find
[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/) useful. I took
[TensorFlow Developer Certification
exam](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) as well. I think these are still
very good courses to learn applied machine learning. Having said that, I had
prior programming knowledge and multi-variable calculus, some content might
require a bit of googling if you are lost.

For visualisation techniques, I find [storytelling with
data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) is able to illustrate the rationale
and importance of visualisation in a clearly and actionable matter.

I find [StatQuest](https://statquest.org/) and
[3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) is able to break down complicated
statistical concept into easier intuitive understanding. I like
[mCoding](https://mcoding.io/) content where they talk about the less known
Python bugs and tricks.

I find that online modules are generally very suitable for learning applied
content, but I learned more theoretical concepts in modules and textbooks.
Applied content refers to actually writing the code and using it to solve a
problem. However, I find theoretical understanding is important in fixing the
results, preventing wrong actions and have some prior to decide on which
direction to explore.

### How do I start learning programming language

My programming knowledge started with NUS
[CS1010X](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS1010X/programming-methodology),
[ST2137](https://nusmods.com/modules/ST2137/statistical-computing-and-programming).
I think these modules provide a good overview of programming methodology, and I
start to explore libraries such as Pandas via [Kaggle
Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) and reading other people's articles. If you
have zero knowledge in programming I heard
[CS50X](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) is a good resource.

### How do I start practicing and learning machine learning techniques

As my student exchange was affected by COVID-19, I spent most of the remaining
time in my year 2 sem 2 learning the data science techniques. I participated in
various competitions such as [Kaggle
Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and read a lot of articles on
machine learning's use case. Some good resources I read today includes [The
Batch - DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/) and [Data
Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/), or just journal websites.

### Which Econs and Stats modules are relevant for data roles

It was only in year 3 that I realised many Econs and Stats modules teaches
machine learning concepts, but simply does not call themselves machine learning
modules. For historical/domain reasons, statistics use "statistical learning"
and economics use "econometrics" to refer to "machine learning" techniques,
which is more commonly used by computer science majors (as far as I understand).

Furthermore, techniques such as "time series forecasting", "Bayesian statistics"
are commonly used data science techniques, yet not commonly mentioned when
people mentioned "machine learning".

Therefore, please refer to the modules I took in year 3 and 4 for module
inspiration. The most importance textbooks/books in general that I have read
includes the "holy bible": ISLR [An Introduction to Statistical
Learning, used in ST3248, ST4248, EC4308](https://www.statlearning.com/), [The Signal and the
Noise, used in EC4303](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Signal_and_the_Noise), [Mostly Harmless
Econometrics, used in EC4305](https://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/)

In my year 4 I start to find mathematical programming (or mathematical
optimization) fascinating and relevant. Data science models require
optimization to solve for the parameters, and business questions often require
an optimization setup to be executable. Although economics and statistics do
introduce optimization techniques, there are much more concepts in the
optimization space we did not cover. I took
[MA3236](https://nusmods.com/modules/MA3236/non-linear-programming) and sadly
could not complete the whole module list NUS offers. I continue to explore the
space at my free time.

### What experience did I have

Formally I had 2 internships. My first internship is research assistance with
Institute of Water Policy, LKYSPP. I was responsible for conducting data mining
on Singapore's non-domestic water consumption (data visualisation, statistical
analysis). This internship taught me a lot both in technical and applied aspect.
Under my researcher's guidance, I learned to re-apply research papers on the
current problem, translating statistical results to business partners and
presenting visualisation to tell a story.

My second internship was with Procter
& Gamble, which later converted to my current full time role. I was working for
3 projects spreading from analysis, dashboard building and data science
forecasting and optimization. The 3 projects consolidated my understanding of
various data roles.

Although I find data roles are more defined now than few years ago (judging from
LinkedIn job postings), various companies still does some variations in naming.
For example, P&G has 4 different naming for different kind of data roles (from
analyst, business analytics to data scientist). I will attempt to provide a
quick overview of how I view the different data roles later.

Besides the internship experience, I also wrote an honours thesis on applying
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model in asset pricing. It was an
independent research paper where I had to build GAN model from scratch, conduct
literature reviews and summarise everything in the 40 page report. I find the
research skills learned from honours thesis continue to be useful when I'm faced
with some concepts I do not understand. You can read my paper
[here](https://github.com/lingjie00/thesis_paper/blob/master/report/thesis.pdf)

### What am I doing now as a data scientist

I'm currently a media and optimization data scientist working for P&G. P&G is a
major player in media space, the highest level of business question I'm
responsible for is how do we best allocate our media spending to deliver media
goals. I'm currently in my first project, and it's integer programming based
problem.

### What level of programming proficiency is required

I think it is hard to quantify the programming level needed. For example, I
cannot say you need a level 5 Python programming, what does it even mean?
Therefore, I will illustrate what is the expected usage of programming as a data
scientist in P&G.

The keyword revolve around scalability, most machine learning failed because the
models only serve to answer the problem at the instance, but is unable to be
deployed. [read
more](https://www.applause.com/blog/why-machine-learning-projects-fail#:~:text=The%20reality%20is%20that%20your,or%20strategy%20from%20the%20start.)
Therefore, the recent drive in the industry and P&G is
[MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps), to ensure data science solutions
can be fully deployed and integrated into business decisions.

In order to achieve MLOps, data scientist has to work with data engineers,
machine learning engineers to ensure codes are tested, there is automated
testing (Continuous Integration) and automated updating (Continuous Deployment).
The relevant techniques includes [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git),
[GitHub
Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions),
[Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing),
[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and using development
tools such as [Integrated development
environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

I first heard of MLOps in my year 4, but did not pay too much attention to it.
What really trains my development skills are my interest in command line tools
such as [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), I share my
dotfiles [here](https://github.com/lingjie00/cli_settings), dotfiles are
basically config files, [read more
here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dotfiles-what-is-a-dot-file-and-how-to-create-it-in-mac-and-linux/)

Other programming usage includes retrieving data from databases (SQL is
required), building custom models and algorithmic logics (Python is required),
running and deploying models in cloud platform (Google Cloud Platform, Azure
knowledge are required). There are various roles in the data field and not every
one of them require all the programming knowledge.

### What are the data roles available

I segment data roles by how much programming knowledge is minimally required to
perform the job, I will briefly explain their responsibility and output to the
best of my knowledge.

Roles | Minimal programming proficiency required | Responsibility | Output | Example question |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Analyst | Little to no | Strategic business direction, qualitative analysis | Report, presentation | In-depth analysis on digital media effectiveness
Analytics | Moderate to high | KPI tracking, quantitative analysis | Report, dashboard | Real-time tracking of digital media performance
Scientist | High | Forecasting, optimization | Model | Forecasted digital media performance and ideal budget allocation

Various data roles serves the same common goal: advising business to make better
decisions with data. For example, if the business is deciding on expanding into
Tiktok, then analyst will first provide the market landscape and business
opportunity through for example in-depth interviews and survey data, while
analytics will design tracking metrics to understand the new campaign
performance. Finally, data scientist will help to decide on the actual direction
and investment in the next campaign.

All data roles are equally important. A data scientist request large historical
dataset before model building, while analyst can rely on domain knowledge and
strong business prior to make decision before any investment. A good project
might not be recognized without an accurate measurement done by the analytics
team. On one hand, relying purely on business intuitive will likely failed to update
the belief despite changing market trends, data scientist is able to provide
model and data based recommendation that is constantly updated by the latest
data. On the other hand, strong domain knowledge and prior are required when
there is little information available or when data is filled with noise.

Beside the business facing data roles, there are engineering positions such as
data engineers, machine learning engineers. Different companies will likely have
different responsibilities despite using the same job title. I rely on the job
descriptions for a more accurate information on the roles.

I find [365 Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience) provide
useful videos on the job scopes for each data role.

### Preparing for P&G interview

P&G is open regarding hiring procedures and questions asked, I rely solely on
the public information on [hiring
process](https://www.pgcareers.com/hiring-process). The most important tip is to
answer interview questions using CAR - Context Action Result. 

### Can a economics undergraduate enter data field

Yes of course. There are various relevant modules you have studied, and many
online resources available for you to bridge the gap.

In my personal opinion, if you are thinking about this question then most
likely you are having an implicit assumption: economics modules does not train
any technical skill sets. However, assuming you are following the quantitative
economics track then you have directly relevant skill set for data roles. There
is nothing worse than going to an interview self doubting yourself. If you can't
even trust yourself, then who will?

Alternatively, you might be worrying about competition. Data science field is
getting more popular nowadays, and it's rightly to feel worried about the
competitions from statistics, data science, computer science, and engineering
majors. However, you need to understand your own value proposition to know what
roles are suitable for you and you are interested in.

For example, business facing data roles (from analyst to scientist) will require
domain understanding, such as consumer behaviours to decide on the most
important data features and analysis to be conducted. Social science majors
generally have a good understand of how society function, from my personal
experience.

However, if you are interested in engineering roles such as building dashboard,
engineering product such as natural language processing, then you have to be
very proficient in programming and related concepts.

Lastly, growth mindset is important. If you are interested in data scientist
positions, many roles will require engineering skills on top of statistics,
and business domain understanding. If the company tests LeetCode questions,
please do practice them. Even if you do not have strong proficiency now, it does
not mean you will never master them in the future. I believe in growth mindset:
everything can be learned. However, I also acknowledge different talents:
everything can be learned, but different people learned at different pace. It is
important to find an area you can learn at the fastest pace, but do not give up
when the learning gets slow.
